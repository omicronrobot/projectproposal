	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to the trajectory planning of mobile platforms characterized by non-holonomic constraints and constraints on the steering angle and steering angle rate. The approach is based on geometric reasoning and provides deterministic trajectories for all pairs of initial and final configurations (position x, y, and orientation \{theta\}) of the robot. Furthermore, the method generates trajectories taking into account the forward and reverse mode of motion of the vehicle, or combination of these when complex maneuvering is involved or when the environment is obstructed with obstacles. The trajectory planning algorithm is described, and examples of trajectories generated for a variety of environmental conditions are presented. The generation of the trajectories only takes a few milliseconds of run time on a micro Vax, making the approach quite attractive for use as a real-time motion planner for teleoperated or sensor-based autonomous vehicles in complex environments. 10 refs., 11 figs.},

The problem of finding the "smoothest path" joining two given configurations is solved (a configu ration is a position and a direction). Generally, we solve the problem using two "simple " path segments. The most important issue is how to define the smoothness cost of a path. We pro pose two distinct definitions: the first is the path curvature, and the second is the derivative of the path curvature. We use cir cular arcs with the first definition, and we use "cubic spirals" with the second for "simple curves" respectively. The set of cubic spirals has several advantages when used in smooth-path planning, one of which is curvature continuity. This theory also reveals other important concepts in robotics, such as "symmet ric configurations " and "symmetric means. " This algorithm has been successfully implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11 at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at the Naval Postgraduate School.},

The relationship between the rigid body motion of the robot and the steering and drive rates of wheels is developed. In particular, conditions are obtained that guarantee that rolling without skidding or sliding can occur. Explicit differential equations are derived to describe the rigid body motions that arise in such ideal rolling trajectories. The simplest wheel configuration that permits access of arbitrary rigid-body motions is determined. Then the question of slippage due to misalignment of the wheels is investigated by minimization of a non- smooth convex dissipation functional that is derived from Coulomb's Law offriction. It is shown that this minimization principle is equivalent to the construction of quasi-static motions. Examples are presented to illustrate the models.},

	doi = {10.1109/70.265916},
	abstract = {Since a vehicle with two or more steerable drive wheels is always traveling in a circle about an instantaneous center of rotation, the motion of the wheels is constrained. The wheel translational velocity divided by the radius to the center of rotation must be the same for all wheels. When the drive wheels are controlled independently using position control, the motion of the wheels may violate the constraints and the wheels may slip. Consequently, substantial errors can occur in the position and orientation of the vehicle. A vehicle with N steerable drive wheels has N holonomic constraints on the steering angles, (N-1) nonholonomic constraints on the wheel velocities, and one degree of freedom. The authors have developed a new approach to the control of a vehicle with N steerable drive wheels. The novel aspect of their approach is the introduction of variables to control the constraint forces. To control the vehicle, the authors have one variable to control motion and (N-1) variables that can control the constraint forces to reduce errors. Kankaanranta and Koivo (1988) developed a control architecture that allows the control variables for force and position to be decoupled. In the work of Kankaaranta and Koivo the control variables for force are an exogenous input. The authors have made the central variables for force endogenous by defining them in terms of the errors in satisfying the nonholonomic constraints. The authors have applied the control architecture to the {HERMIES}-{III} robot and have measured a dramatic reduction in error (more than a factor of 20) compared to motions without constraint force control.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The system is driven by six actuators: one actuator connected to one roller of each wheel, and three more actuators controlling the orientation of the ball-carriers with respect to the platform. Analysis of the mathematical model of this system using the holonomy matrix yields conditions under which the system can be rendered holonomic. Holonomy can be achieved by keeping the ball-carriers in pure translational motion. Therefore, the control of the system can be simplified by imposing constraints on the ball-carriers that prevent them from changing their orientation with respect to an inertial frame.},

This ball wheel mechanism can be designed to yield fully mobile vehicles that are not only free of any kinematic singularity but are configuration invariant in kinematic behavior. Invariant kinematics greatly simplifies the control of smooth and precise vehicle motion. Multiple displacement sensors are easily incorporated into each ball wheel mechanism. This unique feature enables the detection of slip between tires and the floor and also indicates at which tire the slip occurs. This allows traction control to be implemented to fully exploit the available floor friction while accurate dead reckoning navigation continues from two non slipping tires. A prototype vehicle with three ball wheel mechanisms is implemented. Smooth motion and precise dead reckoning are accomplished.},

	abstract = {Nonholonomic mechanical systems are revisited. This review article focuses on Lagrangian formulations leading to a system of governing equations free of constraint forces. While eliminating the constraint forces, the number of scalar Lagrange equations is reduced to a number of independent equations lower than the original system with constraint forces. In the process of constraint-force elimination and dimension-reduction, a matrix that appears to play a relevant role in the formulation of the mathematical models of mechanical systems arises naturally. We call this matrix here the holonomy matrix. It is shown that necessary and sufficient conditions for the integrability of the constraints in Pfaffian form are readily derived using the holonomy matrix. In the same vein, a class of nonholonomic systems is identified, of current engineering relevance, that is termed quasiholonomic. Examples are included to illustrate these concepts.

	url = {http://dl.lib.uom.lk/handle/123/10482},
	abstract = {Most mobile platforms or vehicles used today are non holonomic. They only have one or two independent degrees of freedom. Due to that its maneuverability is limited and often requires much space to control functions like turning and parking. By improving degrees of freedom (improving the maneuverability) of a vehicle, it can follow many complex trajectories that are difficult or impossible by conventional non holonomic vehicles. Any mobile platform that has three independent degrees of freedom in a plane is a holonomic platform. Independent degrees of freedom means that it can change its orientation or position without effecting other motions unlike in car type vehicles that require turning or changing its orientation when need to move. Holonomic motion is very useful to acquire abilities such as, avoid any obstacle while keeping its orientation the same, capability to move in constrained spaces and track a target while moving in an arbitrary trajectories etc. Because of these advantages and capabilities some of the scientific and industrial researches are targeting to develop holonomic mobile platforms. Already robotics community have managed to build some working models and used in applications like robot soccer games and mobile robot manipulators. Many different mechanisms have been created to achieve the holonomic capability. These include various arrangements of Swedish wheels or omni wheels, chains of spherical or cylindrical wheels, ball wheels and powered caster wheels etc. While most of these designs are practical in indoor environments they are not suitable for outdoor operations in large scale versions. In this research project our goal was to develop a viable design to achieve holonomic capability that minimizes these problems and more suited to outdoor operations. The proposed design has a wheel arrangement similar to a car but with the capability of independent driving and steering capability of each of the four wheels. Car type rolling and steering mechanism avoid any uneven wear of the wheels and avoid lateral forces applied on the wheels. Wheel driving and steering mechanism was designed such a way that wheels can be steered 360 degrees continuously without interfering with the wheel drive system. This enables the platform to move in complex trajectories continuously without stopping for wheel resetting. The developed platform has increased ground clearance that is necessary for outdoor rough terrain operations like farming. Although these benefits exist, controlling the robot to acquire the desired motion is very complex and need innovative algorithm. Four independent wheels with eight degrees of freedoms to achieve three degree of freedom motion is a redundant control problem and require complex control system. Using inverse kinematics model of the platform and multiprocessor design with advance micro-controllers we have tried to solve these issues and were able to achieve successful performance.},

The geometry and design of the mobile robot are the principal attributes that guarantee an omnidirectional motion. Furthermore, the platform uses an active spherical wheel and four passive spherical wheels to get the best stability when the robot uses a terminal element (Kärcher). The proposed model has been designed to improve the omnidirectional motion issues, such as vibration into the platform or lack of punctual contact between the wheel and the floor, compared to mobile robots using Mecanum wheels and more than one active wheel; due to the design concept, all the mathematical formulations, kinematics and dynamics presents how the models are validated with computer simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between the wheel axle and the steering axle along the direction of wheel travelling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of the offset steered driving wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating the wheel axis and the steering axis
independently. The wheel is a nonholonomic system, and we introduce a control strategy to avoid a nonholonomic constraint. Simulation results of the single driving wheel and the two-wheeled vehicle are performed to test the control method. The concept of offset steered driving wheel is implemented and tested on a prototype of the holonomic omnidirectional vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate high mobility of the vehicle prototype},
